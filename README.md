# TumblPress

Imports Tumblr posts into WordPress, and crossposts WordPress posts to Tumblr. Also adds options to "clean up" Tumblr crossposts (delete older than *n* days) and likes.

## Requirements

**1.** Configure your site with the PHP OAuth class: http://php.net/manual/en/book.oauth.php

**2.** Get a Tumblr API key: https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps

**3.** Edit `tumblr.class.php` to change `$conskey` and `$conssec` to the values obtained in #2.

**4.** Upload to your WordPress site.

**5.** Enjoy!
